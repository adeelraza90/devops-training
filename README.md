- Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
	CI: Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible.
	CD: Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.
	Continuous Deployment: Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

- What are the benefits of Cloud Computing
	Scalability.
	Collaboration.
	Unlimited Storage Capacity.
	Back-up and Restore Data.
	High Speed â€“ Quick Deployment.
	Automatic Software Updates and Integration.
	Efficiency and Cost Reduction.
