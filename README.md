- Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
	CI: Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible.
	CD: Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.
	Continuous Deployment: Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.
