- Agile vs DevOps
	Agile focuses on cross-functional team communication and deploying constant iterative releases. DevOps focuses on uniting the Development and Operations teams in a continuous development process.Agile focuses on cross-functional team communication and deploying constant iterative releases.

- Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
	CI: Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible.
	CD: Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.
	Continuous Deployment: Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

- What are the benefits of Cloud Computing
	Scalability.
	Collaboration.
	Unlimited Storage Capacity.
	Back-up and Restore Data.
	High Speed â€“ Quick Deployment.
	Automatic Software Updates and Integration.
	Efficiency and Cost Reduction.

- Difference b/w Git & Github
	Git is installed and maintained on local system rather than in the cloud and is focused on version control and code sharing. On the other hand Github is a service hosted on the web and is focused on centralized source code hosting.

- Stages of Git
	Working Directory: Where actual code resides in local PC
	Staging Area: test env where code is ready to be sent in local repo
	Local: repo of local PC where code is ready to be committed to remote repo
	Remote: Local Repo of git where code pushed from local repo
